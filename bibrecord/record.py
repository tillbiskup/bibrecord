Facilities for representing bibliographic records.

Bibliographic records form the basis of bibliographies and proper citations
of other people's work, particularly in humanities and science.


Types of bibliographic records
==============================

The different types of bibliographic records follow closely the standard set
by the BibTeX system.

.. note::

    While currently, not all bibliographic record types BibTeX supports and
    knows are implemented, and for those implemented not all fields are
    supported, the idea is to eventually support at least all record types.


The following types of bibliographic records are currently supported:

* :class:`Article`

  Probably the primary way of publishing nowadays in science is to write an
  article and to submit this article to a journal for publication.

* :class:`Book`

  Books are probably the most important type of literature in general,
  and in science the second important type besides articles appearing in
  journals.

* :class:`Dataset`

  Datasets are increasingly seen as independent research output that should be
  citable. A typical use case of this record type would be a package
  containing some published data where for each record, the relevant
  dataset should be referenced.

For details, have a look at the documentation of the respective classes.


Base classes
============

Key to the module is a series of base classes that make implementing classes
for concrete types of bibliographic records straight-forward and simple:

* :class:`Record`

  Base class for each bibliographic record.

* :class:`Person`

  Representation of a person's name.

  Names consist, according to BibTeX, of four parts: first (given names),
  last (family name), particle (*e.g.*, von), suffix (*e.g.*, Jr., III). To
  properly handle these four parts and to allow for switching between "FIRST
  LAST" and "LAST, FIRST" mode of display is the duty of this class.


Implementing additional types
=============================

All types of bibliographic records inherit from :class:`Record`. Usually,
there is not much left to do to implement an additional class, besides
setting the properties (aka fields of the bibliographic record) in the
constructor. However, a few things are crucial and deserve explicit
mentioning:

* Attributes should be settable using the constructor.

  This greatly facilitates using the classes in their original intended
  setting, namely storing bibliographic records within a class implementing
  an algorithm in a somewhat structured and natural way.

* Each type needs to implement a non-public attribute :attr:`_type` that is
  set to ``__class__.__name__``.

* The constructor needs to call the constructor of the super class,
  by using ``super().__init__(key=key)``. Note that here, the key is passed.
  Hence, add the key property explicitly to your class constructor as well.

* Provide a default format in the property ``self.format``.

Taken together, the constructor of a class may look as follows (this is a
stripped-down example of the :class:`Book` class):

.. code-block::

    def __init__(self, key='', author=None, title='', publisher='', year=''):
        super().__init__(key=key)
        self.author = author or []
        self.title = title
        self.publisher = publisher
        self.year = year
        self.format = 'author: title. publisher, year.'
        self._type = __class__.__name__

Please note that author (and editor) fields are always lists. Hence,
the default is not the empty list (as this is mutable), but ``None``.
Therefore the property is set to either the value of the constructor
keyword or to the empty list.

    Base class for each bibliographic record.

    Actual bibliographic records are represented by classes inheriting from
    this class. The types of bibliographic records follow those known from
    BibTeX.

    Attributes
    ----------
    format : :class:`str`
        Format string used to create string representation of record

        Return string representation of a bibliographic record.

        The format of the resulting string is controlled by the property
        :attr:`format`. There, you can use all the public properties of the
        class that form part of the bibliographic record, such as "author",
        "title", and alike.

        The properties "author" and "editor" are treated specially, to ensure
        the names to be appropriately formatted.

        Similarly, the property "doi" is treated specially, prefixing the
        string "doi:" to make it easier to recognise.

        .. note::
            The aim of this method is currently in no way to allow for
            advanced formatting including conditionals, as possible with
            BibTeX styles. It only provides a rudimentary way of converting
            a bibliographic record into a string representation.

        As you can see from this example, the output is quite opinionated,
        although BibTeX as such would allow for some slightly different
        formatting as well. To highlight the most important aspects:

        * Values are surrounded by curly brackets, not quotation marks.

        * The type of record is capitalised.

        * Indentation is done using tabulators.

    reverse : :class:`bool`
        Whether to reverse last and first name in output

        Default: False


    Examples
    --------
    There are different usage scenarios for this class. The first is to
    populate the properties of an object from a (BibTeX) string:

    .. code-block::

        person = Person()
        person.from_bib('John Doe')

    This will result in the object ``person`` having set "John" as its
    property "first" and "Doe" as its property "last". Note that a person's
    name consists (according to BibTeX) of four parts. See :meth:`from_bib`
    for details.

    The other way round, you may want to have a string representation of a
    person's name, either in plain text representation or for use within a
    BibTeX record:

    .. code-block::

        string = person.to_string()
        bib_string = person.to_bib()

    The difference of these two methods is quite subtle, and only present if
    at least one of "particle" or "suffix" is present. In the latter case,
    :meth:`to_bib` will return a string that can be understood by BibTeX,
    *i.e.* with reversed order of names, meaning the first name output last
    and separated by a comma.

    One use case (and the original reason for writing this package) is to
    specify a bibliographic record within another class, for example in case
    you've implemented an algorithm and want to give credit to the original
    authors in a somewhat portable way. As you can directly give the
    properties on object instantiation, this looks quite natural:

    If you would want to output the above reference as a string, simply use
    the :meth:`to_string` method:

    .. code-block::

        reference.to_string()

    With the default format, this would result in the following text:

    .. code-block:: text

        J. Timmer, M. König: On generating power law noise. Astronomy and
        Astrophysics 300:707--710, 1995.

    Note that the line break is a matter of display here and not contained
    in the original string output. Of course, if you would like to revert
    the names, *i.e.* having the first name printed last, this can be done
    as well:

    .. code-block::

        reference.reverse = True

        Astrophysics 300:707--710, 1995.

    If you would want to create a BibTeX record from this, make sure to
    first add a key:

    .. code-block::

        reference.key = 'timm-aaa-300-707'
        reference.to_bib()

    The output of ``print(reference.to_bib())`` would look as follows:

    Thus, you can easily create a BibTeX bibliography from your bibliography
    records that should work well with BibTeX.

    Similarly, if you have a book that has an editor (or a list of editors)
    rather than an author/authors, you would define your bibliographic
    record like so:

    .. code-block::

        reference = Book(
            editor=['Arnold J. Hoff'],
            title="Advanced EPR. Applications in Biology and Biochemistry",
            publisher="Elsevier",
            year="1989",
            address="Amsterdam"
        )

    If you would want to output the above reference as a string, simply use
    the :meth:`to_string` method, as before:

    .. code-block::

        reference.to_string()

    With the default format, this would result in the following text:

    .. code-block:: text

        Arnold J. Hoff (Ed.): Advanced EPR. Applications in Biology and
        Biochemistry. Elsevier, Amsterdam 1989.

    Note that the line break is a matter of display here and not contained
    in the original string output.

class Dataset(Record):
    """
    Bibliographic record for a dataset.

    Datasets are (fortunately) increasingly seen as independent research
    output that should be citable. While published datasets are only as good
    (and useful) as they are annotated, in general publishing data is an
    excellent idea.

    The class currently closely follows the fields available from Zenodo.
    Furthermore, the dataset record type is not part of the original BibTeX
    record types (as the idea of publishing datasets is much younger than
    BibTeX), but is included in biblatex starting with version 3.13.


    Attributes
    ----------
    author : :class:`list`
        List of author names (as strings)

        Note: You should only provide either authors or editors.

    editor : :class:`list`
        List of editor names (as strings)

        Note: You should only provide either authors or editors.

    title : :class:`str`
        Title of the dataset

    publisher : :class:`str`
        Name of the publisher of the dataset (*e.g.*, "Zenodo")

    year : :class:`str`
        Year the dataset was published

    version : :class:`str`
        Version of the dataset cited

        Note that datasets often have version numbers or strings

    doi : :class:`str`
        Digital object identifier referring to the dataset

    url : :class:`str`
        Uniform Resource Location (URL) referring to the dataset

    Examples
    --------
    One use case (and the original reason for writing this package) is to
    specify a bibliographic record within another class, for example in case
    you've implemented an algorithm and want to give credit to the original
    authors in a somewhat portable way. As you can directly give the
    properties on object instantiation, this looks quite natural:

    .. code-block::

        reference = Dataset(
            author=['John Doe'],
            title="Lorem ipsum",
            publisher="Zenodo",
            year="2024",
            version="2024-01-29",
            doi="10.5281/zenodo.00000000",
        )

    If you would want to output the above reference as a string, simply use
    the :meth:`to_string` method:

    .. code-block::

        reference.to_string()

    With the default format, this would result in the following text:

    .. code-block:: text

        John Doe: Lorem ipsum (2024-01-29).
        Zenodo, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.00000000, 2024.

    Note that the line break is a matter of display here and not contained
    in the original string output. Of course, if you would like to revert
    the names, *i.e.* having the first name printed last, this can be done
    as well:

    .. code-block::

        reference.reverse = True
        reference.to_string()

    With the default format, this would result in the following text:

    .. code-block:: text

        Doe, John: Lorem ipsum (2024-01-29).
        Zenodo, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.00000000, 2024.

    If you would want to create a BibTeX record from this, make sure to
    first add a key:

    .. code-block::

        reference.key = 'timm-aaa-300-707'
        reference.to_bib()

    The output of ``print(reference.to_bib())`` would look as follows:

    .. code-block:: text

        @Dataset{,
            author = {John Doe},
            title = {Lorem ipsum},
            publisher = {Zenodo},
            year = {2024},
            version = {2024-01-29},
            doi = {10.5281/zenodo.00000000}
        }

    Thus, you can easily create a BibTeX bibliography from your bibliography
    records that should work well with BibTeX/biblatex.
