"""
Facilities for representing bibliographic databases.

While individual bibliographic records are handled by the
:mod:`bibrecord.record` module and BibTeX files and records are dealt with by
the :mod:`bibrecord.bibtex` module, this module provides means to handle
bibliographic databases, *i.e.* a collection of individual
:obj:`bibrecord.record.Record` objects.


Use cases
=========

If you "only" want to have a bibliographic record as an attribute in a class,
say for an implementation of an algorithm where you would like to give credit
to the people who originally described the algorithm, one of the subclasses of
:class:`bibrecord.record.Record` is what you are usually interested in.

However, suppose you write a package that contains data from different sources
(*i.e.*, with different references) and you want to provide these
references for each individual dataset. In this case, you will probably
have a BibTeX bibliography file somewhere in the package data of your
package that would be the original source of the bibliographic information.
In this case, being able to convert this BibTeX bibliography file into an
actionable representation for your package would come quite handy. This is
what the :class:`Database` class provides you with.

Creating such a database is a matter of only a few lines. Suppose your BibTeX
database to reside in the file "literature.bib":

.. code-block::

    import bibrecord

    bibliography = bibrecord.bibtex.Bibliography()
    bibliography.from_file("literature.bib")
    database = bibrecord.database.Database()
    database.from_bibliography(bibliography)

Now you can access all bibliographic records from your :obj:`Database` object.

class Database:

    Database of bibliographic records.

    Each record is of type :class:`bibrecord.record.Record` (actually, it is
    a subtype corresponding to the actual BibTeX entry type). Records are
    stored in the :attr:`records` attribute as a dictionary whose keys are
    the BibTeX keys used to cite the bibliographic record and the
    corresponding value the instance of the corresponding
    :class:`bibrecord.record.Record` subclass.


    Attributes
    ----------
    records : :class:`dict`
        Bibliographic records

        The keys are the BibTeX keys used to cite the bibliographic record and
        the value the instance of the corresponding
        :class:`bibrecord.record.Record` subclass.


    Examples
    --------
    Suppose you have a BibTeX database residing in the file "literature.bib".
    Creating a database containing the records in a form processable by the
    bibrecord package requires a few steps:

    .. code-block::

        import bibrecord

        bibliography = bibrecord.bibtex.Bibliography()
        bibliography.from_file("literature.bib")
        database = bibrecord.database.Database()
        database.from_bibliography(bibliography)

    The result is a database containing bibliographic records in a form
    that is processable by the bibrecord package and hence from within your
    code.

        Populate database from bibliography.

        Each BibTeX entry in the bibliography will be converted to an object
        of the corresponding :class:`bibrecord.record.Record` subclass if this
        exists and added to the :attr:`records` dictionary. The key is the
        BibTeX key of the BibTeX entry used to cite the entry,
        the corresponding value the :class:`bibrecord.record.Record` object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bibliography : :class:`bibrecord.bibtex.Bibliography`
            Representation of a BibTeX bibliography, *e.g.* as read from a
            file.
