Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.2
===============

* Logo?


For later versions
==================

* Remaining standard BibTeX record types

* Adding all optional properties for record types?

    * If so, differentiate between required and optional types?
    * How to handle author/editor fields, where one needs to be present (are they mutually exclusive for some record types?)

* String replacement in BibTeX records (*e.g.*, for journal names)

* Explicitly support biblatex-defined record types?

  `<https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf>`_

* Handling of "and" in lists of names? (Caution: internationalisation?)

* Template engine for string output formats
