Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.2
===============

* ``from_bib`` method for :class:`bibrecord.record.Record` class


For later versions
==================

* Remaining standard BibTeX record types

* Adding all optional properties for record types?

* Explicitly support biblatex-defined record types?

  `<https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf>`_

* Handling of "and" in lists of names? (Caution: internationalisation?)

* Template engine for string output formats
