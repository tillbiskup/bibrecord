Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* Record type for books

* General documentation (README, ...)


For version 0.2
===============

* Remaining standard BibTeX record types

* Handling of "and" in lists of names? (Caution: internationalisation?)


For later versions
==================

* Template engine for string output formats
